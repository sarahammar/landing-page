### About the project
this is the first project in Udacity web development Nanodegree, Landing Page.
it is a multi-section landing page, its navigation bar updates dynamically, and when the user scrolls to any section on the page it is have been highlighted. 

### The Navigation Bar:
I designed it using javascript. first, I put the sections and the ul in global variables.
second I put the length of Divs that contains the sections in the global variable.
and i used the "createDocumentFragment()" method for better performance.
Then i biuld the navbar.

### Highlighting the active section:
When the user scrolls to any section on the page it is have been highlighted, I made two steps for that, first I write a function to locate the active section. then I looped over the sections find what section is active and highlight it.

### Technologies used to create the project: HTML, CSS, Javscript.
